# Doctor Appointment Booking System Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a complete doctor appointment booking system built using the **MUNCHECK stack** (MongoDB, Node.js, React, Express.js, Cloudinary). The platform allows users to choose from different doctors, book appointments, and make cash payments. It features an **Admin Panel** with two logins: one for the admin and one for doctors. Doctors can manage their appointments, view their earnings, and update appointment statuses, while admins have full control over the platform, including managing doctors and viewing all appointments in real-time.
